This is the README for manskel.

manskel is the skeleton source for a file to be converted by txt2tags to
produce a man page and also the look of a man page to show as (x)html.

Copy the skeleton to a file of your choice, conventionally with the
extension .t2t. Alter the text inside to suit that required by your
application then produce the man page thusly:

	txt2tags -t man yourfile.t2t

The result will be yourfile.man which I suggest you rename to
yourfile.1. You may also gzip it to yourfile.1.gz but unless your
man page is > 4k bytes that is pointless.

You can produce an xhtml version like this:

	txt2tags -t xhtml yourfile.t2t

This will produce yourfile.xhtml.

Read the fine man page for txt2tags for more information.
